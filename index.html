        <h1>Person-Places in Life, Fiction, and Software</h1>

        <em>This unfinished post explores two categories of things: persons and places. Both of those categories can be thought of as spectra: each thing has a degree of placeness and a degree of personhood between 0 and 1. The intersection of the two categories is particularly interesting at a time when software is becoming both intelligent and omnipresent. In this post, I suggest looking into technological, religious, and fictional person-places as inspiration for interfaces of new smart technologies.</em>

        <h2>What is a Person?</h2>

        <p>All human beings are persons.</p>
        <p>Not all humans have historically enjoyed an equal level of legal personhood, and we generally treat outgroupers as having less personhood than members of our ingroups.</p>
        <p>Personhood is in the eye of the beholder. We treat our inert dolls and cars as persons, but don't extend the same treatment to our rather intelligent food animals.</p>

        <h3>Can software be a person?</h3>
        <p>Software can be designed in a way that encourages its users to view it as a person.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the most basic level, this can be accomplished through conversational copy tone and a brand with a well defined personality
          <li>More sophisticated software can offer conversational interfaces to users
          <li>The most sophisticated software can use artificial intelligence to actually talk to the user</li>
          <li>Some software attains personhood organically, through a hive-mind of its users (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Community_and_culture">reddit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a>). We can describe such software as being "polite", "rude", "hostile", or "welcoming". We can talk about them "knowing" and "remembering"</li>

        <h2>What is a place?</h2>
        <p>We don't normally consider human beings to be places unless we're on the magic school bus or are using a spacial metaphor like Pixar's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/">Inside Out</a>.</p>
        <p>Pencils are not places at all, while houses certainly are. The size of the object correlates somewhat with its placeness, but function is more important: a cardboard box is not really a place until a cat tries to sit in it.</p>
        <h3>Can software be a place?</h3>
        <p>Software often uses spacial metaphors. On the desktop, the best known examples are window and file managers. On the web, they are the aptly named <em>sites (</em>as distinct from pages, which are more similar to documents).</p>
        <p>Most video games, from Pac Man to Half Life, are places. As virtual and augmented reality becomes mainstream, spacial metaphors from videogames are likely to find their way into the larger world of software. Our brains are good at navigating (and remembering) 3D spaces, so we will easily acclimate to virtual libraries (either in VR space or superimposed on real shelves), conference rooms (Facebook at Work), shopping malls, and hangout spots.</p>

        <h2>Places inhabited by Persons</h2>
        <p>If you live in a city, most places that you visit are not <em>just</em> places.

        <h3>Banks, stores, houses</h2>
        <h3>Genius Loci and haunted houses</h2>
        <h3>In software</h2>
        <p>[ clippy, siri, candy crush, okcupid ]</p>
        <h3>Advantages</h2>
        <p>[ agent (e.g. siri) can accompany user between places ]</p>

        <h2>Places that <em>are</em> Persons</h2>
        <p>In science fiction, intelligent places are described as artificial intelligences whose bodies are physical places like cars, spaceships, or buildings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Aperture Science</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT">KITT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL</a>). In the horror genre, they appear as <a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/when-buildings-kill">haunted houses</a>. They frequently appear in folktales and fairytales, as in the Slavic story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga">Baba Yaga</a>.</p>

        <h3>Smart buildings</h3>

        <h3>Smart ships and vehicles</h3>

        <h3>Navajo Hogans</h3>
        <p><a href="#footnote-hogan" class="footnote-link">The Navajo Hogan</a> is a residential place that is treated as a person. Hogans are personified in everyday speech, and are treated as living beings that need to be fed, cared for, spoken to, and shielded from loneliness.</p>
        <p>The Hogan demonstrates that it's possible to relate to a place as a person even without the digital magic of interactivity.</p>

        <h3>Physical and digital communities</h3>
        <p>Places with strong communities, whether digital or real, can also be perceived as persons. For example, nations are often personified both by members of the nation and outsiders with whom it interacts.</p>

          <p>From <a href="http://www.jammed.com/~mlb/hogan.html" target="_blank">The Navajo House Blessing Ceremony</a> by Michelle L. Biehl:</p>
          <blockquote> <p>The hogan is most often treated like a living object by its inhabitants. It needs to be taken care of and loved to sustain the harmony of the Navajo home life. "Hogans are personified in ordinary conversations - they are alive; they need to be fed, cared for, spoken to, and shielded from loneliness" (Frisbie 1980: 166). The ceremony then, not only serves the needs of its inhabitants, but it serves the needs of the hogan. The ritual aims to "feed the house, show proper treatment and respect to it, prevent timber breakage, and remove the hogan's loneliness" (176). The hogan's loneliness, before the ceremony is performed, is a dangerous thing; it can attract evil spirits.</p> </blockquote>

          <p><strong>Hiveminds</strong>, <strong>cultures</strong>, and <strong>egregores</strong> describe groups of people that behave (or are seen as) as a single organism.</p>
          <p><strong>Corporations</strong> are machines that are treated as a persons in some legal contexts. We also mentally model corporations as persons to some extent, viewing them as having personality, and forming relationships with them.
